They actually crowd-sourced their data and had people use their app to build their dataset and add venues and complete any missing information they had in their dataset. Currently its location data is the most comprehensive out there, and quite accurate that it powers location data for many popular services like Apple Maps, Uber, Snapchat, Twitter and many others, and is currently being used by over 100,000 developers, and this number is only growing. \n",
